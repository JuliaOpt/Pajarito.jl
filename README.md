# Pajarito

Pajarito (**P**olyhedral **A**pproximation in **J**ulia: **A**utomatic **R**eformulations for **I**n**T**eger **O**ptimization) is a mixed-integer convex programming solver package written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/). Pajarito combines state-of-the-art convex and mixed-integer linear solvers by constructing sequential polyhedral approximations of the convex parts with a guaranteed finite-time convergence under minimal assumptions. Pajarito supports both **mixed-integer conic programming** and **smooth, derivative-based mixed-integer nonlinear programming**.

## Installation

Pajarito can be installed through the Julia package manager:

```
julia> Pkg.add("Pajarito")
```

## Should I use Pajarito?

Pajarito is a solver for mixed-integer convex optimization problems. These are optimization problems where some variables are restricted to take discrete (e.g. binary) values, and the problem becomes convex when the discreteness constraints are relaxed. If your problem falls into this class, you may consider using Pajarito.

## Using Pajarito

Pajarito has two entirely separate algorithms depending on the form in which the input is provided. The first is the **derivative-based nonlinear** algorithm, where the approach used is analogous to that of [Bonmin](https://projects.coin-or.org/Bonmin) and will perform similarly, with the primary advantage of being able to easily swap-in various mixed-integer and convex subproblem solvers which Bonmin does not support. The second is **conic** algorithm which is the new approach proposed in the publications describing Pajarito. The conic algorithm currently supports second-order cones, exponential cones, and positive semidefinite cones. A problem provided in conic form may solve faster than an identical problem encoded in derivative-based nonlinear form because conic form naturally encodes extended formulations; however, [Hijazi et al.](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2011/06/3050.pdf) suggest manual reformulation techniques which achieve many of the algorithmic benefits of conic form.

The table below describes the different ways to access the two algorithms in Pajarito.

|                             | [JuMP][JuMP-url]            | [Convex.jl][convex-url]  | [MathProgBase][mpb-url] |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Derivative-based nonlinear  | X (e.g., `@NLconstraint`)   |                          | [X][mpb-nlp-url]        |
| Conic (incl. MISOCP, MISDP) | X (no automatic conversion) | X (automatic conversion) | [X][mpb-conic-url]      |

* MISOCP: mixed-integer second-order cone programming
* MISDP: mixed-integer semidefinite programming

JuMP and Convex.jl are algebraic modeling interfaces, while MathProgBase is a lower-level interface for providing input in raw callback or matrix form. Convex.jl is perhaps the most user-friendly way to provide input in conic form, since it transparently handles conversion of algebraic expressions. JuMP supports conic modeling but requires cones to be explicitly specified, e.g., by using `norm(x) <= t` for second-order cones and `@SDconstraint` for positive semidefinite constraints.

Pajarito may be accessed through MathProgBase from outside Julia by using the experimental [cmpb](https://github.com/mlubin/cmpb) interface which provides a C API to the low-level conic input format.

## Subproblem solvers

The algorithm implemented by Pajarito itself is relatively simple, and most of the hard work is performed by subproblem solvers. Pajarito requires two different subproblem solvers, one for mixed-integer linear problems and one for convex subproblems. **The performance of Pajarito depends on the subproblem solvers.** For best performance, use commercial solvers.

The mixed-integer linear solver is specified by using the `mip_solver` option to `PajaritoSolver`, e.g., `PajaritoSolver(mip_solver=CplexSolver())`. You must first load the Julia package which provides the mixed-integer linear solver, e.g., with `using CPLEX`.

The convex subproblem solver is specified by using the `cont_solver` option, e.g., `PajaritoSolver(cont_solver=IpoptSolver())`. When given input in derivative-based nonlinear form, Pajarito requires a derivative-based nonlinear solver, e.g., [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt) or [KNITRO](http://www.ziena.com/knitro.htm). When given input in conic form, the convex subproblem solver can be *either* a conic solver like [ECOS](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/ECOS.jl) *or* a derivative-based solver like Ipopt. If a derivative-based solver is provided in this case, then Pajarito will switch to the derivative-based algorithm by using the [ConicNonlinearBridge](https://github.com/mlubin/ConicNonlinearBridge.jl) package. Note that using derivative-based solvers for conic problems can cause numerical instability because conic problems are not always smooth.

All solvers can have their parameters specified through their corresponding Julia interfaces. For example, you probably should turn off the output of the subproblem solvers, e.g., by using `IpoptSolver(print_level=0)`.

**Pajarito is not yet numerically robust and may require tuning of parameters to improve convergence.** If the default parameters don't work for you, please let us know.
